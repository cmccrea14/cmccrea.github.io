            for 3 to 4 days? Fattoush is basically the Caesar salad of the Arab 
            world and it’s a staple side dish on the dinner table in Ramadan. 
            Let’s make this tangy and crunchy salad to enjoy throughout the week
            !

        <h2>Prepping The Salad Jars</h2>
        <p>
            Making these salad jars takes 30 minutes and you’ll have delicious 
            salads ready to go all week long! The only thing you have to do is 
            just chop a lot of vegetables and make the dressing. Let’s start 
            with the vegetables – these are all the ones you need:
            <ul>
                <li>romaine lettuce, thinly chopped</li>
                <li>cucumbers, diced</li>
                <li>tomatoes, diced</li>
                <li>pepperoncinis, chopped</li>
                <li>black olives, sliced</li>
                <li>red onions, thinly sliced</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that everything is chopped, we can start assembling the jars! 
            The key to these jars and why they can last four days without going 
            soggy or brown is because the vegetables are arranged from most wet 
            to least wet, starting from the bottom to the top. This way the 
            lettuce stays nice and crunchy!
        </p>
        <p>
            The wettest ingredients are tomatoes and pepperoncinis so they 
            should stay on the bottom. Then black olives if you’re using them. 
            You can also use any other olives you like. After that, add 
            cucumbers, then red onions, feta cheese, and lettuce. Finish it off 
            with the freshly chopped mint and parsley and that’s it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now let’s make the dressing – these are all the ingredients you 
            need:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>pomegranate molasses</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>black pepper</li>
                <li>sumac</li>
                <li>lemon juice</li>
                <li>dried mint</li>
                <li>allspice</li>
                <li>minced garlic</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Add all the ingredients to a mason jar and shake together well until
            combined well. You can also use an electric whisk to make it all 
            come together into one! Feel free to taste it and adjust anything 
            to your liking.
        </p>
        <h2>Vegetable Chopper</h2>
        <p>
            If you hate chopping vegetables like I do sometimes, it’s great to 
            invest in one of these vegetable choppers. It makes the whole 
            process of prepping salads so much easier. I’m sure you’ve seen this
            appliance all over TikTok but you basically just add the vegetable 
            in, push down, and it chops everything into equal sections 
            perfectly each time. It is also dishwasher safe so you don’t have 
            to worry about scrubbing into every nook and crevice every time you
            use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It took me a while to hop on to this hack but I’ve been using it 
            almost every single day since. You obviously don’t need this chopper
            to make this recipe, you can do it all by hand. But in case you 
            were wondering from the video what it was!
        </p>
        <h2>Where To Buy Jars And Dressing Containers</h2>
        <p>
            You can use any large air-tight jars you have in your kitchen or in 
            the store! Here is the link to the jars I used and they were 27 
            ounces. Try to find jars around this size.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few options for the dressing! If you’ll just be enjoying
            these salads at home, you can just store it all together in one 
            mason jar and drizzle some on whenever you toss together a jar. If 
            you plan to take them to go, you can purchase little sauce/dressing
            containers like these, divide them into four, and just store them 
            in the fridge.
        </p>
        <h2>Varitaions To Try</h2>
        <p>
            There are so many different ways to switch up Fattoush and even this
            recipe has some of my own twists to it! It typically doesn’t have 
            spicy peppers, black olives, or feta cheese in it but I just love 
            the flavors they add. If you love spicy like me, you can add 
            pepperoncinis, cherry peppers, or pickled jalapenos.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s talk tomatoes now. I used grape tomatoes cut in half in this 
            recipe but you can also use roma tomatoes or grapevine tomatoes that
            have been diced!
        </p>
        <p>
            I also love making my own pita chips from scratch because it tastes 
            so much better and it’s actually really easy. If you don’t want to 
            make your own, just buy some from the store to make this recipe even 
            that much easier. I highly recommend trying to make them on your own
            once though!
        </p>
        <h2>How Long Does This Last In The Fridge?</h2>
        <p>
            These last in the fridge for 3 to 4 days which is why I never make 
            more than 4 jars! Just make sure to pat try very well after washing 
            all the ingredients you use like lettuce to ensure it lasts long 
            without wilting.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <h5>Make The Dressing</h5>
                <li>
                    To a jar, add all the ingredients for the dressing - olive 
                    oil, pomegranate molasses, lemon juice, garlic, sumac, dried
                    mint, black pepper, salt, and allspice.
                </li>
                <li>Shake around until evenly combined and set aside.</li>
                <h5>Make The Pita Chips</h5>
                <li>
                    To a pan over medium heat, heat up vegetable oil to shallow 
                    fry. When the oil is hot, add the chopped pita and stir 
                    every now and then so it browns evenly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once golden, take out the oil and drain any excess oil on a 
                    paper towel. Optional, season with a sprinkle of salt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow them to cool down completely and store them in a 
                    ziploc bag.
                </li>
                <h5>Assemble The Jars</h5>
                <li>
                    To layer the jars, we'll start with the most wet ingredients
                    at the bottom to least wet at the top to keep everything 
                    crunchy and fresh.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Start with chopped pepperoncinis at the bottom. Then add the
                    chopped tomatoes, sliced black olives, diced cucumbers, red
                    onions, feta cheese, lettuce, and finally a bit of chopped
                    parsley and fresh mint.
                </li>
                <li>Seal the jars up.</li>
                <li>
                    In four small containers, divide the dressing into four 
                    equal amounts and seal it up.
                </li>
                <li>Store everything in the fridge.</li>
                <li>
                    Whenever you want to enjoy a salad, empty the jar and 
                    dressing into a bowl and toss it all together. Add the pita 
                    chips in and enjoy!
                </li>
            </ol>
