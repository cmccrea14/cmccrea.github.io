                    Overwatch (abbreviated as OW) is a multimedia franchise 
                    centered on a series of multiplayer first-person shooter 
                    (FPS) video games developed by Blizzard Entertainment. 
                    Overwatch was released in 2016 with a successor, Overwatch 2
                    , released in 2022. Both games feature hero-based combat 
                    between two teams of players vying over various objectives, 
                    along with other traditional gameplay modes.

                    Released in 2016, the first video game in the series lacked 
                    a traditional story mode. Instead, Blizzard employed a 
                    transmedia storytelling strategy to disseminate lore 
                    regarding the game's characters, releasing comics and other 
                    literary media, as well as animated media that includes 
                    short films. The game enjoyed both critical and commercial 
                    success, and garnered a devoted following.

                    Blizzard helped launch and promote an esports scene 
                    surrounding the game, including an annual Overwatch World 
                    Cup, as well as the Overwatch League and a minor league, 
                    which borrowed elements found in traditional American sports
                    leagues.
